        <p>
            An existing object model can be loaded into the AR viewer through an online depository.<br />
            An example repository containing a limited range of object files can be found <a href="https://github.com/GraceBa/GraceBa.github.io/tree/master/MolViewer/Models">here</a>.<br />

        <p>
            The "Load obj model" tab in the menu defines a marker and a model within a specific directory. <br />
            When "import model" is clicked, the defined model is displayed on the defined marker (unless the file does not exist). <br />
            When "remove model" is clicked, the defined model is removed from the defined marker. <br />
            When "clear marker" is clicked, all models on the defined marker are removed. 
            Only one instance of a marker can be used at any one time. <br /> 
        </p>
        <p>
            The directory from which an object is loaded is explained in <a href="#changingSources">Changing sources</a>.

        <hr />
        <p>
            For ease of access, only the name of an object or marker is needed in the "Load obj model" tab.
            A specific naming convention is used to enable this to work. By default, a sample model repository is used.<br />

        </p>
        <img src="https://graceba.github.io/MolViewer/Images/ChangeSourceTab.png" />
        <p>
            The "Change source" tab in the menu allows the user to define a custom location for importing object models and marker patterns.
            It should be noted that only online directories will be recognised. If a non-existent directory is called, no models will be loaded
            until a valid address is given.
            The default directory can be restored in each case by clicking "revert".

            Markers are read by the program from .patt files. 
            .patt files are text files the AR Viewer program interprets in recognising real-world markers.
            The directory to a file location is defined using the format:<br />
            &emsp; <a style="color: gray;">https://example_directory.com/ Marker .patt</a> <br />
            where "Marker" is the marker defined in <a href="#loadingObjModel">Loading an object model</a>.
            <br />
            <br />

        <p>
            Markers are simple symbols framed by a black square which function as real-world targets to place virtual models on.
            Users can design their own symbols and use <a href="https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html" target="_blank">this site</a>
            to generate a marker and corresponding .patt file. It is recommended that the default frame thickness (50%) is
            used to produce reliable markers.

            Models are read by the program from .obj files for shape, and .mlt files for colour. The directory to a file location is defined using the format:<br />
            &emsp; <a style="color: gray;">https://example_directory.com/ Model .obj</a> and <br />
            &emsp; <a style="color: gray;">https://example_directory.com/ Model .mtl</a> respectively.<br />
            Both files are defined by the same "Model" name in <a href="#loadingObjModel">Loading an object model</a>.
            This requires the files to be located in the same directory with the same name.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shape objects may be loaded with non-existent material files, and will be displayed as a solid white object.
